# 🧠 AI Stats Charter

> “AI should belong to humanity — not just the highest bidder.”

This document defines what AI Stats stands for.  
It is the charter by which all code, data, and decisions in this project are guided.

---

## 🌍 1. Our Vision

AI Stats exists to **open the AI ecosystem** — to make every model, benchmark, and provider accessible through one open gateway.  
We believe AI is a public good — a foundation for progress — not a product to be fenced off.

---

## 🧭 2. Our Principles

### 1. Transparency

All models, benchmarks, and data are public.  
Every number, request, and update can be verified.  
There is nothing hidden behind a paywall or marketing spin.

### 2. Fair Access

AI Stats will always aim to keep costs as **low as possible**, never profiting at the expense of accessibility.  
Some compute has a cost — but **we will never charge more than necessary**.

### 3. Interoperability

The world doesn’t need more silos.  
AI Stats connects all models, from all providers, through a single, open standard.  
Any developer, anywhere, can build on it.

### 4. Collaboration

We build in public, together.  
Anyone can contribute — code, data, or ideas.  
No gatekeeping, no elitism — just curiosity and progress.

### 5. Sustainability

We believe openness must be sustainable.  
Revenue and operations exist only to keep the project alive — not to exploit its users.  
Transparency extends to our pricing, infrastructure, and roadmap.

## ⚙️ 3. Our Commitments

-   We will always publish updates, changes, and pricing publicly.
-   We will document every provider equally and fairly.
-   We will support open data formats and encourage interoperability.
-   We will never prioritise one company or model because of financial incentives.
-   We will strive to empower developers, researchers, and creators — not replace them.

---

## 💡 4. Our Belief

AI is not about replacing humans — it’s about **amplifying them**.  
The future of intelligence is collective, not corporate.

---

## 🔮 5. The Long View

AI Stats is built for the long term — to outlast trends and hype cycles.  
We’re building the public infrastructure for the AI era, brick by brick, together.
