# 🤝 Contributing to AI Stats

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  
AI Stats is a community-driven project — built in public, by people who believe that AI should be **open**, **transparent**, and **accessible** to everyone.

This guide explains how you can get involved.

## 🧠 Our Philosophy

AI is reshaping the world — but access to it is increasingly closed off behind paywalls, restrictions, and vendor lock-ins.  
AI Stats exists to change that, by providing an **open, unified layer** that connects to every model, everywhere.

Whether you write code, improve docs, share ideas, or report bugs — you are helping keep AI open.

## ⚙️ Development Basics

To work on the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DanielButler1/AI-Stats.git

pnpm install

# Run all apps
pnpm dev
```

> You don’t need to run everything at once — work on the part that excites you most.

## ✅ Pull Request Guidelines

Fork the repository and create a new branch:
git checkout -b feature/my-improvement

Make your changes.

Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions.

Reference any related issues.

Open a PR for review.

We prefer small, focused PRs over giant ones ― they’re easier to review and merge.

---

## Release workflow

The monorepo now uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to track releases for the SDK packages, the gateway API, and the web UI. To publish a release:

- Run `pnpm changeset` and select the workspaces you want to release (for example `@ai-stats/ts-sdk`, `@ai-stats/gateway-api`, `@ai-stats/web`, or `@ai-stats/py-sdk`). The Python workspace exists solely for tooling and stays private.
  - Run `pnpm changeset:version` to bump every affected `package.json`, emit changelog entries, and automatically sync `pyproject.toml`. The Mintlify docs site uses its own version selector, so `apps/docs/docs.json` (and its `api.version` entry) are maintained separately.
- Use `pnpm sdk-py:sync-version` whenever you need to resync `pyproject.toml` (for example if you roll back a change or edit the file manually) before publishing to PyPI.
