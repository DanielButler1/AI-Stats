## 🌟 What is AI Stats?

With new AI models launching what feels like **multiple times every week**, it’s hard to keep up.  
**AI Stats** offers a **clean, open, and collaborative** platform to:

-   📊 Explore recently released models
-   🔍 Compare benchmarks and capabilities
-   📈 Track performance over time
-   🛠️ View model details and pricing information

The **entire project is community-driven** and licensed for non-commercial use. If something’s missing or incorrect, you can help fix it!

## 💡 Why This Exists

This project was born out of frustration:  
There was **no central place** to quickly check:

-   What models have recently launched
-   How they compare on a wide range of benchmarks
-   What their strengths and limitations are
-   How much they cost to use

AI Stats is our answer - a platform that keeps pace with the rapid evolution of AI.
