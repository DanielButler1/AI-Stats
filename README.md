## 🌟 What is AI Stats?

With new AI models launching almost **every week**, it’s hard to keep up with what's out there. **AI Stats** solves that by providing a **clean, open, and collaborative** way to:

-   📊 View recently released models
-   🔍 Compare benchmarks and capabilities
-   📈 Track performance over time
-   🛠️ See improvements, context lengths, providers, and more

And best of all?  
The **entire project is community-driven**. The code and data are provided under a non-commercial license, so if something’s missing or incorrect, you’re empowered to help fix it.

## 💡 Why This Project Exists

This project was born out of frustration - there was **no single place** where you could quickly check:

-   What AI models have recently been released
-   How they compare to others on benchmarks
-   What their limitations or strengths are

We wanted to build a site that **keeps pace with the rapid evolution** of this field, and now we invite the community to help us make it even better.

## 🙌 Get Involved

**We want your contributions. Yes, you.**

Whether you’re a developer, researcher, hobbyist, or AI enthusiast - there’s a way for you to help:

Model missing? Benchmark result outdated? Context length recently increased?  
➡️ **You can fix that.**

-   Fork the repo
-   Edit or add model data in the `models/` folder (JSON format)
-   Submit a pull request with a clear title and description
-   We’ll review it and merge it if everything looks good!

### 💡 Suggest Features or Report Bugs

Open a GitHub issue to:
