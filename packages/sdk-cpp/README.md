# AI Stats C++ SDK (preview)

Generated from the AI Stats Gateway OpenAPI spec. The current wrapper (`index.cpp`) surfaces only the `models` endpoint as a starting point.

Status:
- **Preview**: Not published yet. Will be released once the API surface stabilises.
- Generate with `pnpm openapi:gen:cpp`.

Usage (after generation):
- See `examples/models.cpp` for a minimal call to `/models`.

Note: Python and TypeScript SDKs are fully supported today; other languages will follow soon.
