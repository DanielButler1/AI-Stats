# AI Stats Go SDK (preview)

This package is generated from the AI Stats Gateway OpenAPI spec. Only the `models` endpoint is surfaced via the thin wrapper in `index.go` today.

Status:
- **Preview**: Not published yet. Will be released to `pkg.go.dev` once the API surface is hardened.
- Generated via `pnpm openapi:gen:go`.

Usage (after generation):
```go
client := aistats.New("<API_KEY>", "https://api.ai-stats.phaseo.app/v1")
resp, _, err := client.GetModels(context.Background(), nil)
```

Python and TypeScript SDKs are fully supported today; other languages will follow soon.
