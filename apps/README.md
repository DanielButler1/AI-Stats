# Apps Directory

This folder holds the three main parts of **AI Stats** — each a core piece of the ecosystem.

| App              | Description                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| [`web`](./web)   | The public website and dashboard.   |
| [`docs`](./docs) | The Mintlify-powered documentation. |
| [`api`](./api)   | The Cloudflare-based API gateway.   |

Each can run independently, but they’re designed to work together — forming a complete open infrastructure for model tracking and access.
