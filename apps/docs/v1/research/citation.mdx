description: "How to acknowledge AI Stats data, benchmarks, and gateway tooling in your work."
---

AI Stats aggregates public information and benchmark results from model providers and evaluation projects.  
If you rely on AI Stats to look up, compare, or monitor models, a simple acknowledgement helps others discover the platform.

## Quick version

If AI Stats was helpful, please just link to it somewhere appropriate (methods, footnote, or acknowledgements):

> This work uses model metadata and aggregated benchmark results from [AI Stats](https://ai-stats.phaseo.app).

## Benchmark data

AI Stats **does not run benchmarks itself**. We surface and normalise scores reported by benchmark authors and model providers.

When you use benchmark results that you accessed via AI Stats:

1. Cite the original benchmark and paper as the primary source.
2. Optionally acknowledge AI Stats as the place you retrieved or compared the scores.
3. Include:

-   Benchmark name and split (for example `MMLU test`).
-   Model identifier and provider.
-   URL to the relevant AI Stats page or API.
-   Date accessed.

Example text:

> Benchmark scores were retrieved via AI Stats (MMLU test split), accessed 3 March 2025. Model: `openai-gpt-4o`, provider: OpenAI.

## Gateway and tooling

When describing integrations, you can mention AI Stats as the gateway layer rather than as a research benchmark source:

> "We used the AI Stats Gateway to unify access to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models through a single API."

Link directly to the [API reference](/v1/api-reference/introduction) so readers can explore further.
