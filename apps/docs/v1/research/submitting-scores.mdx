description: "Share new benchmark results with the AI Stats community in a structured, reviewable way."
---

We welcome contributions from providers, researchers, and power users. Follow the workflow below to ensure your submission is processed quickly.

---

## 1. Prepare your data

-   Confirm the benchmark exists in `/data/benchmarks`. If not, create an issue to propose it.
-   Collect the raw results, including prompt format, evaluation harness, and hardware details.
-   Provide a public citation (blog post, paper, or dataset repository) when available.

> ✅ **Tip**
> Sharing a reproducible script or notebook speeds up verification significantly.

---

## 2. Fork the repository

1.  Fork [github.com/ai-stats/data](https://github.com/ai-stats/data).
2.  Create a new branch (for example `add-claude-3.5-sonnet-mmlu`).
3.  Update the relevant benchmark JSON with your scores and metadata.

---

## 3. Run validation

Use the repository tooling to ensure structure and ranges are correct:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run validate:benchmarks
```

Fix any reported issues before submitting your pull request.

---

## 4. Open a pull request

Include the following in your PR description:

-   Benchmark name and split (for example `GSM8K test`).
-   Model ID and provider.
-   Links to citations or evaluation logs.
-   Summary of how the score was produced.

Maintainers will review, request clarifications if needed, and merge once approved.

---

## 5. Track publication

After merge, the score appears in the next scheduled data sync. You can follow progress in the #data-updates channel on Discord or the public changelog.
