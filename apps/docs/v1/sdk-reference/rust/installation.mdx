## Installation

**Coming Soon** - The Rust SDK is currently in preview and not yet published to crates.io.

For now, you can generate and use the client locally:

- Requires Rust 1.74+ and Cargo.
- Regenerate client: `pnpm openapi:gen:rust` (writes to `packages/sdk-rust/src/gen`).
- Add `packages/sdk-rust` as a path dependency in your `Cargo.toml`.

```bash
pnpm openapi:gen:rust
```
