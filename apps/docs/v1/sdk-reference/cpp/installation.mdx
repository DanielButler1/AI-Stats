<Note type="warning">This package is yet to be published on C++ package managers, and will be coming ASAP.</Note>

```bash
conan install ai-stats-cpp-sdk
```

## Installation

**Coming Soon** - The C++ SDK is currently in preview and not yet published to a package registry.

For now, you can generate and use the client locally:

- Requires C++17 toolchain.
- Regenerate client: `pnpm openapi:gen:cpp` (outputs to `packages/sdk-cpp/src/gen`).
- Include the generated sources in your build and link against the required dependencies from the OpenAPI generator output.

```bash
pnpm openapi:gen:cpp
```
