<Note type="warning">
  **SDKs are in very early alpha**: We're working as hard as we can to get them into a stable state. Please bear with us as we iterate rapidly.
</Note>

- Status: Preview (not yet on NuGet).
- Generate with `pnpm openapi:gen:csharp`.
- Wrapper `packages/sdk-csharp/Client.cs` exposes `GetModels`.

```csharp
var client = new AiStatsSdk.Client("YOUR_KEY");
var models = client.GetModels(limit: 5);
Console.WriteLine(models.Models?.Count);
```

TypeScript and Python SDKs are production-ready; other languages follow soon.
