<Note type="warning">
  **SDKs are in very early alpha**: We're working as hard as we can to get them into a stable state. Please bear with us as we iterate rapidly.
</Note>

<Note type="warning">This package is yet to be published on NuGet, and will be coming ASAP.</Note>

```bash
dotnet add package ai-stats-csharp-sdk
```

## Installation

**Coming Soon** - The C# SDK is currently in preview and not yet published to NuGet.

For now, you can generate and use the client locally:

- Requires .NET 8.0+.
- Regenerate client: `pnpm openapi:gen:csharp` (writes to `packages/sdk-csharp/src/gen`).
- Reference the project or copy the generated sources into your solution.
- Use the convenience `Client` wrapper in `packages/sdk-csharp/Client.cs`.

```bash
pnpm openapi:gen:csharp
```
