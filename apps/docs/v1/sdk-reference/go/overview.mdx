description: "Generated client for the AI Stats Gateway. Models endpoint only for now."

<Note type="warning">
  **SDKs are in very early alpha**: We're working as hard as we can to get them into a stable state. Please bear with us as we iterate rapidly.
</Note>

- Status: Preview (not yet published to pkg.go.dev).
- Generate with `pnpm openapi:gen:go`.
- Wrapper in `packages/sdk-go/index.go` exposes `GetModels`.

```go
client := aistats.New("YOUR_KEY", "https://api.ai-stats.phaseo.app/v1")
resp, _, err := client.GetModels(context.Background(), nil)
if err != nil { panic(err) }
fmt.Println(resp.Models)
```

TypeScript and Python SDKs are production-ready; other languages follow soon.
