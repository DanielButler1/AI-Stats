<Note type="warning">This package is yet to be published on Go modules, and will be coming ASAP.</Note>

```bash
go get github.com/ai-stats/sdk-go
```

## Installation

**Coming Soon** - The Go SDK is currently in preview and not yet published to a package registry.

For now, you can generate and use the client locally:

- Ensure Go 1.21+.
- From the repo root run `pnpm openapi:gen:go` to regenerate the client.
- In your Go module, point to the generated code (preview path): `replace github.com/ai-stats/sdk-go => ./packages/sdk-go/gen`.
- Import the convenience facade from `packages/sdk-go`.

```bash
pnpm openapi:gen:go
```

```go
import aistats "packages/sdk-go"
```
