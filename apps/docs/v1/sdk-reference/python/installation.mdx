<Note type="warning">
  **SDKs are in very early alpha**: We're working as hard as we can to get them into a stable state. Please bear with us as we iterate rapidly.
</Note>

## Installation

Install the SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install ai-stats-py-sdk
```

## Requirements

-   Python 3.9+
-   `httpx` (automatically installed as dependency)

## Setup

### API Key

You'll need an AI Stats API key to use the SDK. Get one from the [AI Stats Dashboard](https://ai-stats.phaseo.app).

### Environment Variables

Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export AI_STATS_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Basic Usage (Async)

```python
import asyncio
from ai_stats import AIStats

async def main():
    async with AIStats(api_key="your-api-key") as client:
        response = await client.chat_completions(
            model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
        )
        print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Basic Usage (Sync)

```python
from ai_stats import AIStatsSync

with AIStatsSync(api_key="your-api-key") as client:
    response = client.chat_completions(
        model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
    )
    print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```
