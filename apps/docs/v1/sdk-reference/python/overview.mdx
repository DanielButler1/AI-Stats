<Note type="warning">
  **SDKs are in very early alpha**: We're working as hard as we can to get them into a stable state. Please bear with us as we iterate rapidly.
</Note>

The AI Stats Python SDK provides an asynchronous-first, type-safe Python client for the AI Stats Gateway API. Built with modern Python features, it offers both async and sync interfaces with rich type hints.

## Features

-   **Async-first**: Built with `asyncio` and `httpx` for high performance
-   **Type-safe**: Full type hints for modern Python editors and IDEs
-   **Dual interface**: Both async (`AIStats`) and sync (`AIStatsSync`) clients
-   **Streaming support**: Built-in streaming helpers for real-time responses
-   **Comprehensive**: Covers all Gateway API endpoints

## Quick Example

```python
import asyncio
from ai_stats import AIStats

async def main():
    async with AIStats(api_key="your-api-key") as client:
        response = await client.chat_completions(
            model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}]
        )
        print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])

asyncio.run(main())
```

## What's Included

-   `AIStats` async client for high-performance applications
-   `AIStatsSync` sync client for simpler use cases
-   Streaming helpers for real-time responses
-   Rich type hints and error handling
-   Full API coverage including chat completions, models, credits, and more
