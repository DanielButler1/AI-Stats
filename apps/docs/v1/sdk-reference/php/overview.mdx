description: "Generated client for the AI Stats Gateway. Models endpoint only for now."

<Note type="warning">
  **SDKs are in very early alpha**: We're working as hard as we can to get them into a stable state. Please bear with us as we iterate rapidly.
</Note>

- Status: Preview (not yet on Packagist).
- Generate with `pnpm openapi:gen:php`.
- Wrapper `packages/sdk-php/src/index.php` exposes `getModels`.

```php
$client = new \AIStats\Sdk\Client('YOUR_KEY');
$resp = $client->getModels(['limit' => 5]);
```

TypeScript and Python SDKs are production-ready; other languages follow soon.
