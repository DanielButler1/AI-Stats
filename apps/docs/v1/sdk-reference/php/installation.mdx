<Note type="warning">
  **SDKs are in very early alpha**: We're working as hard as we can to get them into a stable state. Please bear with us as we iterate rapidly.
</Note>

<Note type="warning">This package is yet to be published on Packagist, and will be coming ASAP.</Note>

```bash
composer require ai-stats/php-sdk
```

## Installation

**Coming Soon** - The PHP SDK is currently in preview and not yet published to Packagist.

For now, you can generate and use the client locally:

- Requires PHP 8.1+ and Composer.
- Regenerate client: `pnpm openapi:gen:php` (outputs to `packages/sdk-php/src/gen`).
- Add the generated source to your autoloader or package it as a local path.

```bash
pnpm openapi:gen:php
```
