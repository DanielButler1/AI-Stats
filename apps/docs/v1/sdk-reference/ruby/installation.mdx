<Note type="warning">
  **SDKs are in very early alpha**: We're working as hard as we can to get them into a stable state. Please bear with us as we iterate rapidly.
</Note>

<Note type="warning">This package is yet to be published on RubyGems, and will be coming ASAP.</Note>

```bash
gem install ai-stats-ruby-sdk
```

## Installation

**Coming Soon** - The Ruby SDK is currently in preview and not yet published to RubyGems.

For now, you can generate and use the client locally:

- Requires Ruby 3.1+ and Bundler.
- Regenerate client: `pnpm openapi:gen:ruby` (outputs to `packages/sdk-ruby/lib/gen`).
- Add `packages/sdk-ruby` to your Gemfile as a path gem.

```bash
pnpm openapi:gen:ruby
```
