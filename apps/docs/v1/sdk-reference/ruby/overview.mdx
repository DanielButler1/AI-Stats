<Note type="warning">
  **SDKs are in very early alpha**: We're working as hard as we can to get them into a stable state. Please bear with us as we iterate rapidly.
</Note>

- Status: Preview (not yet on RubyGems).
- Generate with `pnpm openapi:gen:ruby`.
- Wrapper `packages/sdk-ruby/lib/index.rb` exposes `get_models`.

```ruby
client = AIStatsSdk::Client.new(api_key: "YOUR_KEY")
resp = client.get_models(limit: 5)
```

TypeScript and Python SDKs are production-ready; other languages follow soon.
