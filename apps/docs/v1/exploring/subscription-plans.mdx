## Subscription Plans

This page explains common subscription plans and tiers you may encounter when using API providers listed on AI Stats. It covers typical limits, billing cadence, and how plan features affect access to models and pricing.

---

### What subscription plans cover

-   Rate limits (requests per minute / per day)
-   Included compute or token allowances
-   Access to premium models or features (e.g., JSON mode, dedicated endpoints)
-   Support SLAs and commercial terms

### Typical tiers

Below are common tier examples — exact names and features vary by provider:

-   Free / Trial — limited usage, lower rate limits, no SLA
-   Developer / Hobbyist — low monthly fee, moderate limits for prototyping
-   Business / Team — higher limits, team seats, and priority support
-   Enterprise — custom limits, dedicated support, and contractual SLAs

For detailed per-model pricing and cost-per-token comparisons, see the [Pricing & Performance](/v1/exploring/pricing-performance) page.

If you'd like, I can expand this into a provider-specific breakdown or add a short table comparing example plan features.
