description: "Understand how AI model benchmarks are collected, standardised, and visualised on AI Stats."

Benchmarks are at the heart of how AI Stats measures model quality and progress.  
They provide **objective, repeatable metrics** that help you compare model performance across tasks, domains, and providers — from reasoning and coding to language understanding and image recognition.

---

## What are benchmarks?

A **benchmark** is a dataset or evaluation designed to test a model’s performance on a specific task.  
By running multiple models on the same dataset, we can measure relative strengths and weaknesses.

Common examples include:

-   🧠 **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)** — tests general knowledge and reasoning.
-   🔢 **GSM8K** — tests mathematical reasoning and problem-solving.
-   💬 **HellaSwag** — evaluates common sense and contextual understanding.
-   🧮 **ARC-Challenge** — measures scientific reasoning and logic.
-   💡 **HumanEval** — assesses programming and code generation skills.

---

## How AI Stats handles benchmarks

AI Stats collects benchmark data from **multiple public sources** and **official reports**, then standardises them into a consistent format.

Each model’s benchmark section includes:

-   **Score value** — typically expressed as a percentage or normalised scale.
-   **Dataset source** — e.g. MMLU, GSM8K, etc.
-   **Evaluation method** — indicates how the score was derived (official report, third-party eval, or community submission).
-   **Last updated** — shows when the benchmark data was last refreshed.

## Benchmark categories

Benchmarks are grouped into categories that represent the skill being tested:

| Category                   | Examples               | Description                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reasoning**              | MMLU, GSM8K, ARC       | Tests general logic, multi-step reasoning, and problem-solving.       |
| **Language Understanding** | HellaSwag, BoolQ, PIQA | Measures reading comprehension, common sense, and linguistic ability. |
| **Code Generation**        | HumanEval, MBPP        | Evaluates programming and code synthesis accuracy.                    |
| **Math & Science**         | GSM8K, MATH, SciQ      | Focuses on numerical and scientific reasoning.                        |
| **Multimodal**             | MathVista, MMMU        | Combines text and visual comprehension tasks.                         |

## How to interpret scores

| Value Range | Interpretation                                                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **90-100%** | Exceptional — near state-of-the-art performance.                  |
| **80-89%**  | Excellent — capable for most production use cases.                |
| **60-79%**  | Good — reliable for general tasks but may struggle on edge cases. |
| **< 60%**   | Developing — best for experimental or research scenarios.         |

Keep in mind that some benchmarks have **different scoring systems**.  
AI Stats normalises these where possible to make comparisons more meaningful.

## Visualising benchmarks on AI Stats

Benchmark results are visualised using:

-   📊 **Bar charts** for comparing models within the same dataset.
-   📈 **Trend charts** showing model improvements over time.
-   🧮 **Aggregate scores** to summarise performance across multiple datasets.

Each benchmark dataset on AI Stats includes filters for:

-   Model type (chat, code, embedding, etc.)
-   Provider
-   Release year
-   Dataset category

This lets you quickly identify patterns — like which families dominate reasoning or coding tasks.

---

## Data sources and methodology

AI Stats aggregates benchmark data from:

-   Official research papers and model reports.
-   Provider evaluation pages (OpenAI Evals, Anthropic Reports, etc.).
-   Open community datasets (e.g. Hugging Face leaderboards).
-   Direct submissions from users via GitHub.

All data is standardised and verified before being published.  
See [Research & Methodology → Benchmark Methodology](/v1/research/benchmark-methodology) for full details.

## Example use cases

| Goal                                 | Example                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compare reasoning models             | “Which model scores highest on GSM8K?”                               |
| Evaluate cost-performance trade-offs | “Does GPT-4o justify its higher cost compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet?” |
| Track yearly progress                | “How much has MMLU accuracy improved since 2022?”                    |
| Research benchmarks by category      | “Which models lead in multimodal reasoning?”                         |
