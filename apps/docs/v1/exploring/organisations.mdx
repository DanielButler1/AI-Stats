Every model on AI Stats is linked to an **organisation** - the entity responsible for developing, training, and maintaining that model.  
Organisations form the backbone of the AI ecosystem, and understanding who builds what helps you contextualise each model’s purpose, capabilities, and reliability.

## What an organisation page includes

Each organisation page provides an overview of the company or research group, including:

| Section              | Description                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overview**         | Basic details such as name, description, country, founding year, and website.   |
| **Published Models** | All models released by the organisation, including archived or deprecated ones. |

## Types of organisations on AI Stats

| Type                        | Example                     | Description                                                          |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Research labs**           | OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind | Focused on cutting-edge AI model development and innovation.         |
| **Tech companies**          | Google, Meta, Microsoft     | Deploy large-scale AI infrastructure and consumer applications.      |
| **Startups**                | Mistral, Perplexity, Suno   | Smaller teams building specialised or efficient AI systems.          |
| **Open-source communities** | Hugging Face, Stability AI  | Decentralised collaborations offering transparent model development. |

## Provider vs organisation

It’s important to distinguish between **organisations** and **API providers**:

| Aspect         | Organisation                                | API Provider                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | The creator or maintainer of the model.     | The platform offering API access to that model.                             |
| **Example**    | _Anthropic_ built the Claude series.        | _Anthropic_, _AWS_ and _Google Vertex_ all provide access to Claude models. |
| **Focus**      | Research, training, and model architecture. | Hosting, routing, pricing, and user experience.                             |

Some organisations (like OpenAI or Google) are both the **developer** and **provider**, while others partner with multiple platforms for distribution.
