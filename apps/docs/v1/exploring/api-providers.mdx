**API providers** are the platforms that make AI models accessible via APIs — offering developers and organisations a way to integrate cutting-edge models into their products without managing infrastructure or fine-tuning directly.

While **organisations** are responsible for creating and training models, **providers** focus on **hosting, routing, and delivering** those models efficiently and reliably.

---

## What is an API provider?

An API provider offers programmatic access to one or more AI models, often with additional functionality such as:

-   Authentication and usage management
-   Load balancing and request routing
-   Logging, analytics, and cost tracking
-   Unified APIs or SDKs for multiple models
-   Regional or data-compliant hosting

Examples of providers include:

-   **OpenAI API** — for GPT and Whisper models.
-   **Anthropic API** — for Claude models.
-   **Google Gemini API** — for Gemini 1.5 and Imagen models.
-   **Mistral API** — for Mistral Large and Mixtral models.
-   **AI Stats Gateway** — for unified access across multiple providers.
-   **OpenRouter** — for community-based multi-model routing.

## Provider vs Organisation

| Aspect           | Organisation                   | API Provider                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**      | Develops and trains AI models. | Hosts and serves models via API.                              |
| **Example**      | _Anthropic_ builds Claude.     | _OpenRouter_ or _AI Stats Gateway_ provides access to Claude. |
| **Focus**        | Research and innovation.       | Reliability, access, and developer tools.                     |
| **Distribution** | Limited to their own models.   | May host models from many organisations.                      |

Many providers (like OpenAI or Google) are _both_ — developing and hosting their own models.

## What’s inside a provider page

Each provider listed on AI Stats includes:

| Section              | Description                                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overview**         | Name, website, country, supported endpoints, and data centre locations.                 |
| **Available Models** | List of models hosted by the provider, including their latest versions.                 |
| **Pricing**          | Provider-specific pricing structure (per token, image, or request).                     |
| **Rate Limits**      | Information on daily or per-minute request limits.                                      |
| **Features**         | Supported capabilities like streaming, batch processing, fine-tuning, or custom models. |
| **Endpoints**        | Direct link to API documentation or health endpoints.                                   |
| **SDKs & Tools**     | Links to official or community SDKs, CLI tools, or integrations.                        |

## AI Stats Gateway

The **AI Stats Gateway** itself is also an API provider — but with a twist.  
It acts as a **meta-provider**, offering a unified interface across multiple platforms.

### Benefits of the Gateway

-   🔁 **Unified endpoints** — single format across all supported providers.
-   🪶 **Smart routing** — automatically selects the best available provider.
-   🧠 **Provider-agnostic SDKs** — consistent code, regardless of backend.
-   📊 **Integrated analytics** — usage tracking and cost normalisation.
-   🔑 **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** — connect your own provider API keys.

You can learn more about the Gateway and how to integrate with it in the [Developers Introduction](/v1/developers/introduction).

## Understanding pricing and performance

Each provider’s pricing and performance can vary significantly.  
AI Stats makes this transparent by normalising data into **USD per 1,000 tokens (or equivalent)** and comparing latency metrics where available.

| Metric                             | Description                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Input Price (USD / 1K tokens)**  | Cost of tokens sent to the API.      |
| **Output Price (USD / 1K tokens)** | Cost of tokens generated by the API. |
| **Average Latency (ms)**           | Time from request to response.       |
| **Throughput (tokens/sec)**        | Processing speed of the API.         |
| **Availability (%)**               | Uptime and reliability score.        |

## Choosing a provider

When selecting a provider, consider the following:

-   ⚙️ **Supported models** — ensure the models you need are available.
-   🌍 **Region & compliance** — verify data residency and privacy compliance.
-   💰 **Pricing tiers** — evaluate based on budget and usage volume.
-   🧩 **Integration options** — check for SDKs or tools in your language.
-   📈 **Performance** — look for low latency and high uptime.
-   🔒 **Security** — confirm API key management and authentication methods.

AI Stats aggregates this information for all supported providers to help you make informed decisions.
