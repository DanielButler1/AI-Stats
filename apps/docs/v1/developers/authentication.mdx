title: "Authentication"
description: "Understand how API keys, workspaces, and request headers secure access to the AI Stats Gateway."
---

The Gateway uses bearer tokens for authentication. Every request must include a valid API key issued from your workspace. Keys scope access to specific features, letting you separate environments or team responsibilities.

---

## API keys

-   **API Keys** are scoped to all models and providers available to your organisation.
-   **Provisioning keys** (coming soon) allow you to manage your API keys programatically.
-   **Rotation** is manual today, but you can create a new key at any time without downtime.

Keys follow the format `aistats_v1_k_xx_xxx`. Treat them like passwords and avoid storing them in client-side code or public repositories.

---

## Request headers

Include the key in the `Authorization` header on every request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer aistats_v1_k_ab_cdefghijklmnop
```

Most HTTP clients expose a dedicated configuration property. For example, with `fetch`:

```ts
const response = await fetch(
	"https://api.ai-stats.phaseo.app/v1/chat/completions",
	{
		method: "POST",
		headers: {
			Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.AI_STATS_API_KEY}`,
			"Content-Type": "application/json",
		},
		body: JSON.stringify({
			model: "gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07",
			messages: [
				{ role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
				{
					role: "user",
					content: "Summarise the drawbacks to AI.",
				},
			],
		}),
	}
);
```

## Key management

| Practice            | Why it matters                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Use one key per app | Makes it easy to rotate without affecting other services.                |
| Store keys securely | Secrets managers prevent accidental exposure in logs or error tracking.  |
| Monitor usage       | The dashboard shows per-key metrics so you can detect anomalies quickly. |
| Remove unused keys  | Deleting stale keys reduces the surface area for potential abuse.        |

## Troubleshooting

-   **401 Unauthorized** — The key is missing, invalid, or belongs to a disabled workspace.
-   **403 Forbidden** — The key exists but cannot access the requested provider or model. Check your plan or contact support.
-   **429 Too Many Requests** - You exceeded a rate limit. See the [Rate limits](./rate-limits) guide.
-   **5xx errors** — Retry with exponential backoff and report persistent issues via the support channel.
