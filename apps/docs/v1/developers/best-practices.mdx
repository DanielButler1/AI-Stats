Adopting the Gateway across production workloads is straightforward when you establish strong foundations. Use the recommendations below to improve resilience, security, and maintainability.

---

## Architecture

-   **Isolate provider logic.** Wrap Gateway calls in a dedicated service or SDK so changes stay confined.
-   **Stream responses when possible.** Reduce latency for assistants by streaming tokens to the UI as they arrive.
-   **Batch non-critical jobs.** Queue background generations or evaluations to smooth out traffic spikes.

---

## Security

-   Store API keys in secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, Doppler, 1Password) instead of `.env` files in production.
-   Enable request signing on your own APIs so client applications never expose Gateway keys.
-   Log only truncated keys (for example `sk_prod_abcd…`) to avoid leaking credentials.

---

## Reliability

-   Implement exponential backoff with jitter for all retryable errors (HTTP 429 or 5xx).
-   Respect the [`Retry-After`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After) header before retrying rate-limited requests.
-   Monitor provider metadata to detect automatic failovers from one vendor to another.

## Observability

| Signal        | Recommended action                                                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Latency       | Track p95 and p99 timings to catch regressions early.             |
| Token usage   | Correlate costs with business metrics to evaluate ROI.            |
| Error rates   | Alert when failures exceed 1% for a sustained period.             |
| Provider mix  | Ensure traffic is distributed as expected across vendors.         |

## Collaboration

-   Document prompt templates, input parameters, and output handling in your internal wiki.
-   Share dashboards that highlight benchmark movements and how they affect your product.
-   Encourage regular reviews with product, research, and support teams to keep behaviour aligned.
