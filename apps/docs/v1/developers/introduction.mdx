---

The **AI Stats Gateway** provides a unified API for accessing the world’s leading AI models - all through a single, consistent interface.

Whether you’re building a chatbot, analysing content, generating media, or testing moderation workflows, the Gateway abstracts away individual provider quirks and gives you:

-   **One endpoint** for multiple AI providers
-   **Unified request and response formats**
-   **Transparent usage tracking and pricing**
-   **Lightweight SDKs** and modern developer experience

---

## Why the Gateway exists

Working with multiple AI providers is powerful but messy - each has unique endpoints, model ids and types, and schemas.  
The Gateway removes that friction by providing a normalised API layer that automatically routes your request to the best available model or provider.

You focus on **building**, not integration maintenance.
