All requests to the AI Stats Gateway require authentication via an API key.

You can find or create keys in your **AI Stats Dashboard** under **Keys** in the profile selector or inside of settings.

{/* Add image here of profile selector + Settings */}

## Header-based authentication

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme:

```bash
curl https://api.ai-stats.phaseo.app/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.1",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```
