Credit tracking is handled by the AI Stats Dashboard under **Gateway → Credits**. Every Gateway response includes a `usage` block with token counts and cost metadata so that you can reconcile the per-request spend before the dashboard invoices your team.

Use the dashboard to top up, configure auto top-up, and view the per-category billing breakdown that matches the `model`, `provider`, and `endpoint` values returned from the API.
