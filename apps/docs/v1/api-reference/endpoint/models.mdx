Each catalogue entry now exposes two optional sections so you can tailor the payload to what your client needs:

- `data` – details sourced from the AI Stats dataset such as supported input/output modalities.
- `gateway` – live routing metadata showing the endpoints and providers that are currently active through the gateway.

Pass `include_data=false` and/or `include_gateway=false` to omit either section (both default to `true`). All of the existing filters—`provider`, `organisation`, `include_endpoints`, `exclude_endpoints`, `input_types`, and `output_types`—continue to work exactly the same, and the top-level model metadata (name, identifiers, statuses, aliases, organisation) stays unchanged for backwards compatibility.
