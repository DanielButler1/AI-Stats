Every request to the Gateway must include an `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header with a Gateway API key. Create or rotate keys inside the AI Stats Dashboard under **Gateway → API Keys**, then copy the key into your CLI, SDK, or automation secrets.

Keys start with `aistats_v1_k_` and map directly back to the teams and environments you manage inside AI Stats. Use the [Authentication guide](./authentication) for sample curl, Python, and JavaScript snippets.
