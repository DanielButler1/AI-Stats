Embeddings are generated by routing text requests to the provider that currently offers the most accurate semantic vectors for your selected model. Although the Gateway primarily documents chat completions today, the same model catalogue powers every future embedding workflow.

Use the [Models catalogue](./models) to see which providers identify `embeddings` under their supported `endpoints` array. When the embedding POST endpoint becomes available you will reuse your API key and the same authentication headers as the other Gateway routes.
