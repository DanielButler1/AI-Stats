All errors from the AI Stats Gateway should be returned in a consistent JSON structure:

```json
{
	"generation_id": "G-abc123",
	"status_code": 401,
	"error": "Detailed human-readable message",
	"reason": "error_type"
}
```

Every response includes:

- `generation_id`: a stable identifier you can share with support for faster investigation.
- `status_code`: mirrors the HTTP status to make retries decisions easier.
- `error`: a human-friendly explanation you can display to end users.
- `reason`: a machine-readable error type that aligns with the types listed below.

## Common error types

| Type                   | HTTP Status | Description                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `authentication_error` | `401`       | Missing or invalid API key.                          |
| `authorization_error`  | `403`       | Key lacks permission to access this resource.        |
| `not_found_error`      | `404`       | The endpoint or resource could not be found.         |
| `rate_limit_error`     | `429`       | Too many requests. Retry after the specified delay.  |
| `validation_error`     | `400`       | Invalid parameters or request body.                  |
| `provider_error`       | `502`       | Upstream model provider failed to respond correctly. |
| `server_error`         | `500`       | Unexpected issue within the Gateway.                 |

## Retry strategy

-   **400-series errors:** Fix your request before retrying.
-   **429:** Implement exponential backoff and honour the `Retry-After` header.
-   **500-series errors:** Retry safely after a short delay.

Example:

```js
if (error.type === "rate_limit_error") {
	await sleep(retryAfterMs);
	return retryRequest();
}
```

## Troubleshooting tips

-   Check the [Gateway status page](/status) for ongoing incidents.
-   Review your request payloads — strict JSON validation is enforced.
-   Use the `generation_id` (from the response body) when contacting support as this helps us identify your request.
