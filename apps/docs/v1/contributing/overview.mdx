AI Stats is an **open and community-driven project** - designed to make as much information about AI models, benchmarks, and providers freely accessible to everyone.

Your contributions help keep the platform accurate, transparent, and up to date.  
Whether you’re fixing a typo, adding new benchmark data, or improving documentation, every contribution makes a difference.

## Why contribute?

AI evolves at an ever increasing speed - new models, updates, and pricing changes happen daily.  
By contributing, you help:

-   Keep data on models, organisations, and benchmarks current and reliable
-   Improve the accuracy of AI comparisons across providers
-   Share research insights, community findings, or missing metadata
-   Strengthen the open ecosystem for AI transparency
-   Ensure the database remains freely accessible and community-owned

Your name will also appear in the [Contributors page](https://ai-stats.phaseo.app/contribute), recognising your contributions.
