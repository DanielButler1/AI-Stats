---

Before contributing to AI Stats, it’s important to understand the **layout of the repository**.  
The project is designed for clarity and scalability — separating data, documentation, and app logic so you can easily find what you need.

---

## Overview

Here’s what the root directory of the repository looks like:

```bash

## Data folders

AI Stats stores its structured data in **JSON files** under the `/apps/web/src/data` directory.  
These files act as the source of truth for models, benchmarks, and pricing.

### `/apps/web/src/data/models`

Contains one JSON file per model.  
Each file describes the model’s metadata, pricing, benchmarks, and capabilities.

Example:  
`/apps/web/src/data/models/openai/gpt-5-2025-08-07/model.json`

---

### `/apps/web/src/data/organisations`

Describes companies or research groups behind models.  
Each JSON file includes name, description, founding date, website, and country.

Example:  
`/apps/web/src/data/organisations/openai.json`

---

### `/apps/web/src/data/benchmarks`

Contains benchmark metadata and aggregated results across models.  
Each benchmark has an ID, name, description, category, and metrics.

Example:  
`/apps/web/src/data/benchmarks/mmlu.json`

---

### `/apps/web/src/data/api_providers`

Lists all supported API providers with their supported models.  
This links to both models and organisations.

Example:  
`/apps/web/src/data/api_providers/openai.json`

---

### `/apps/web/src/data/pricing`

Tracks historical pricing data over time for trend analysis.  
Files are timestamped and often aggregated by provider.

---

## Documentation folders

Documentation is written in **MDX** and lives in `/docs/v1/`.  
Each folder maps directly to a group in the Mintlify configuration.

| Folder                   | Purpose                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/docs/v1/exploring`     | Explains data concepts (models, benchmarks, providers). |
| `/docs/v1/contributing`  | Step-by-step guides for contributors.                   |
| `/docs/v1/developers`    | Integration and API usage guides.                       |
| `/docs/v1/api-reference` | Detailed reference for every endpoint.                  |
| `/docs/v1/community`     | Support, FAQ, and roadmap content.                      |

---

## Application folders

| Path         | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/apps/web`  | Main AI Stats website, built with Next.js 15 and TailwindCSS. Contains the data under `src/data`. |
| `/apps/api`  | The API Gateway — routes, caching, and model proxy logic.                                         |
| `/apps/docs` | The Mintlify documentation project you’re reading now.                                            |

Each app runs independently but shares types and configuration through `/packages`.

---

## SDK Packages

The `/packages` directory contains SDKs for various programming languages to interact with the AI Stats API.

| SDK          | Status      | Description                                      |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `sdk-ts`     | Supported   | TypeScript SDK for Node.js and web applications. |
| `sdk-py`     | Supported   | Python SDK for Python applications.              |
| `sdk-csharp` | Coming soon | C# SDK.                                          |
| `sdk-go`     | Coming soon | Go SDK.                                          |

## Automation & scripts

AI Stats uses automation to keep data up to date:

-   **Importers** → pull new data from sources like F1DB, Hugging Face, or provider APIs.
-   **Watchers** → run on a schedule (via GitHub Actions) to detect and commit updates.
-   **Utilities** → handle validation, schema checking, and JSON formatting.

You can explore these under `/scripts/`.

---

## Where to start

If you’re contributing:

-   🧠 **Data:** Look in `/apps/web/src/data/` for JSON files.
-   📄 **Documentation:** Look in `/docs/v1/` for MDX files.
-   ⚙️ **Code:** Explore `/apps/web` or `/apps/api`.
-   🧩 **Automation:** Modify or inspect `/scripts/`.
-   📦 **SDKs:** Check `/packages/` for language-specific SDKs.
