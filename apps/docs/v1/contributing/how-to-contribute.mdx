---

Contributing to **AI Stats** is simple, transparent, and open to everyone.  
This guide walks you through the entire process, whether you’re editing a model entry, updating benchmark data, improving documentation, or contributing new ideas.

---

## Before you start

You’ll need a few basic tools installed:

| Tool               | Purpose                                        | Installation                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Git**            | Version control to clone and push changes.     | [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)       |
| **Node.js (v20+)** | Runs the AI Stats site locally (Next.js).      | [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) |
| **pnpm**           | Package manager used in this project.          | `npm install -g pnpm`                              |
| **GitHub account** | Required for forks, issues, and pull requests. | [Sign up here](https://github.com/signup)          |

If you only want to edit **data** or **Markdown documentation**, you can make changes directly on GitHub without setting up a local environment.

---

## 1. Fork the repository

Go to the [AI Stats GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AI-Stats/AI-Stats) and click **“Fork”** in the top-right corner.  
This creates your own copy of the project that you can freely edit.

---

## 2. Clone your fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Stats.git
cd AI-Stats
```

This downloads your fork to your local machine.

---

## 3. Create a new branch

It’s best practice to make a new branch for each change you make:

```bash
git checkout -b update-benchmark-data
```

Please use a descriptive branch name that reflects your change to make reviewing your changes easier.

Examples:

-   `fix-{model-name}`
-   `add-new-organisation`
-   `improve-docs`
-   `update-pricing-for-{model-name}`

---

## 4. Make your changes

Depending on what you want to edit:

| Area                  | Files                                    | Description                                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model data**        | `/apps/web/data/models/**/*.json`        | Add or update model metadata, pricing, or benchmarks. |
| **Organisation data** | `/apps/web/data/organisations/**/*.json` | Update details about companies or research groups.    |
| **Benchmark data**    | `/apps/web/data/benchmarks/**/*.json`    | Submit new evaluation results or corrections.         |
| **Documentation**     | `/apps/docs/v1/**/*.mdx`                 | Improve or expand guides, references, and docs pages. |
| **Gateway**           | `/apps/api/*`                            | Make changes to the API Gateway.                      |

If you’re editing data, please follow the schemas and field formats described in [Repo Structure](/v1/contributing/repo-structure).

---

## 5. Preview your changes (optional)

If you’d like to preview your edits locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Use [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100) for web changes, and [http://localhost:3101](http://localhost:3101) for docs changes. All data changes will have to be previewed after a PR has been made as the web app pulls from the database.

---

## 6. Commit your changes

Once you’re satisfied, commit your work:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated benchmark data for Claude 3.5 Sonnet"
```

Please ensure your commit message is descriptive of the changes made to help reviewers understand your contribution.

---

## 7. Push your branch

```bash
git push origin update-benchmark-data
```

---

## 8. Create a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to your fork on GitHub.
2. You’ll see a message offering to create a PR - click **“Compare & Pull Request.”**
3. Fill out the PR template with the appropriate information for your changes
4. Submit the PR!

Once your PR is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main AI Stats repository.

---

## 9. Celebrate 🎉

## Contribution tips

-   Keep PRs **small and focused** - one logical change per PR.
-   Attempt to follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) where possible. Use **clear commit prefixes** like `fix:`, `add:`, or `chore:`.
-   If your change affects data accuracy, include **sources or references**.
-   For large or uncertain ideas, open a **GitHub Discussion** or message in Discord before coding.
-   Always stay respectful and follow our [Code of Conduct](/v1/community/code-of-conduct).
