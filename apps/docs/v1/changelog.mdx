# Monitor Overhaul

Today we rolled out an overhaul to the Monitor experience. Changes include:

-   The main monitor table has been moved into the Models page to provide a more integrated, compact and filterable way to explore models: [/models/table](https://ai-stats.phaseo.app/models/table).
-   The previous [/monitor/history](https://ai-stats.phaseo.app/monitor/history) page is no longer a separate page - its timeline and insight functionality has been merged into the main [/monitor](https://ai-stats.phaseo.app/monitor) page. The /monitor page now provides an in-depth timeline and insight tool that records all database changes and gives full transparency over everything that has changed.

# Families Page

We introduced a new Families page (early work in progress) to display groups of models, which we class as families: [/families](https://ai-stats.phaseo.app/families). This view will be expanded over the coming weeks.

# SDKs Alpha Release

Our SDKs are now available in an early alpha stage in V0.2.0. We initially released them with the expectation that the OpenAPI Generator would work seamlessly, but we quickly realized it wasn't performing as expected and needs significant review and improvement. The SDKs are still available for use, but we want to be transparent that they are in alpha and may require updates as we refine the generation process.

If anyone can help with testing these or has experience with OpenAPI generators, we would be very grateful for your input. We want to build a world-class Developer Experience, where AI becomes something so trivial to use, it can easily be added, experimented, used for research, all through our single platform.

We have decided for now to remove the C++ and Rust SDKs from our plans. We might add them back in the future should there be demand, but we are focusing on a smaller set of languages whilst we find the best API generators that we can use and make sure the most used languages are supported. We hope to have all SDKs moved to a V1 ASAP - targeting no later than mid-January 2026.

We also plan to unify all SDK versions alongside the API and Website + Docs at some point in the future for better consistency.

#### Python SDK Alpha

```bash
pip install --upgrade ai-stats-py-sdk==0.2.0a1
```

#### TypeScript / JavaScript SDK Alpha

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash title="npm"
    npm install @ai-stats/sdk@0.2.0-alpha.1
    ```

    ```bash title="pnpm"
    pnpm install @ai-stats/sdk@0.2.0-alpha.1
    ```

    ```bash title="yarn"
    yarn add @ai-stats/sdk@0.2.0-alpha.1
    ```

    ```bash title="bun"
    bun add @ai-stats/sdk@0.2.0-alpha.1
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

# New Monitor Page

We have added a new Monitor page, consisting of two main sections: the [main monitor page](https://ai-stats.phaseo.app/monitor), which provides a more tabular, easily filterable version of the database, all compacted into a single table for quick overview and analysis; and the [history page](https://ai-stats.phaseo.app/monitor/history), which shows all the changes recorded to the database, allowing for full transparency over everything that has changed.

This is still in active development and we will take any suggestions for improvements, or changes either of the pages.

<Note type="warning">
	This Monitor experience was updated on 19th December 2025 - see the 19th
	December update above for full details.

# Improving Our API

## API

The API has received a major breaking change update, introducing OpenAI Compatibility, with the `/responses` endpoint added for unified model responses supporting text, images, and other modalities. We have done this to align with the OpenAI API structure, making it easier for us to add more models, whilst also making it easier for developers to integrate with our gateway if they are already familiar with the OpenAI API. We will always maintain a superset of the OpenAI API to ensure we can support all models and features available on our gateway.

Additionally, the existing `/chat/completions`, `/moderations` and `/embeddings` endpoints have been updated to align with the OpenAI API structure. Other endpoints will be coming soon to provide full OpenAI API compatibility while maintaining the gateway's unified interface and metadata. To be transparent about our future plans, we have added placeholder endpoints and their corresponding documentation. However, models for these endpoints have yet to be enabled. We are looking to bring as many of these endpoints online as soon as possible, providing as many models and as many providers for these models too.

## SDKs

The SDKs have been updated to reflect breaking changes made to the API, this means if you are using the SDKs, you will need to update to the latest major versions and adapt. If any help is needed with this migration, please get in touch and we will be happy to help!

We have also made some substantial progress on SDKs for other languages, with initial versions hoped to be released by the end of 2025 - these will likely be spotted around the website, and documentation, whilst they aren't all available yet, we are working as hard as we can to get them available as soon as possible.

### Updating SDKs

Due to breaking changes, please update your SDKs to the latest versions:

#### Python SDK

```bash
pip install --upgrade ai-stats-py-sdk
```

#### TypeScript / JavaScript SDK

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash title="npm"
    npm update @ai-stats/sdk
    ```

    ```bash title="pnpm"
    pnpm update @ai-stats/sdk
    ```

    ```bash title="yarn"
    yarn upgrade @ai-stats/sdk
    ```

    ```bash title="bun"
    bun update @ai-stats/sdk
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

### Reviewing API Implementations

This is a major milestone on our journey to a V1 API. We hope this will be the last breaking change to the API as we take the decision to align with OpenAI's Standard. Please review your REST API implementations and refer to the updated [API reference](/v1/api-reference) for the latest schema and endpoints. The changes are rather minor, however, please review them.

## Website

The website has undergone significant updates to the Model Gateway Page and Model Pricing Page. The Model Gateway Page is now a Quickstart page, supporting more code samples to get up and running quicker, as well as trimming of unnecessary information on the page. This information has largely been moved to the updated Model Pricing Page, which has been enhanced to provide clearer pricing information and set up for future enhancements across all providers.

We have also added full Cookie Preferences for better user control over privacy settings.

Additionally, we fixed an issue where Model Updates were incorrectly showing as "Today" even when they occurred on historical dates due to our Upgrade to Next.js 16.

We have also tweaked Web Watchers to be more useful.

## Data Changes

A whole host of data changes have been made behind the scenes to improve data accuracy and consistency. We are still working on improving data coverage and accuracy, so please reach out if you spot any issues or have suggestions on how we can improve further!

We are also investigating any quicker ways to gather and update data, so if you have any ideas or suggestions, please get in touch!

## Documentation

We have expanded the SDK documentation in preperation for launching these shortly, with more examples and improved guides for each endpoint to help developers integrate our APIs more easily.

## Infrastructure

We have implemented a Nightly CI process to automatically update model statuses based on their release dates, ensuring the data remains current and accurate.

# Introducing The New AI Stats

We are excited to announce a major update to AI Stats. This is the culmination of months of work to bring a major overhaul to our website and offering. Today, we are introducing a unified model gateway, massively expanded data coverage, and a revamped user experience, as well as much more. This release marks a significant step towards our vision of making AI integration a seamless experience for developers and researchers alike.

## Rebranding

We have rebranded slightly, with adjusted logos and wordmarks to better reflect our mission and vision. The new design is more modern, clean, and versatile, allowing us to better represent our brand across various platforms and media. We hope you like the new look as much as we do!

## Data coverage

At the heart of AI Stats is our database. It is designed to be a highly expansive and flexible store of model data. If you have used AI Stats before, you may know we only used to have text-based models. However, we always wanted to change that, so today we are announcing that we have grown our entire data coverage dramatically to allow us to track more models, such as image, video, and embedding models, in as much detail as possible.

There is still a long road to capture every organisation, model, and benchmark result. We currently sit at ~30% coverage, but we are prioritising expanding this as quickly as possible and aim to reach at least 60% over the next year. We want our database to be the gold standard, whilst still keeping it open source so anyone can contribute. We always welcome contributions to help us get there faster!

### Model Availability

With the introduction of the AI Stats Gateway, we have also reworked how we track model availability. A full subscription plan section now allows you to see all the subscription plans we track, the models they include, and the features they offer, as well as clearly seeing the price. We have also adjusted how we display availability to make it clearer and easier to see where models are available. We plan to continue tweaking this section to make it as useful as possible.

## Data Overhaul

We have revisited what data we store, how we store it, and how we present that data, so we have built a smoother, more reliable experience across every page. It is not perfect yet, and we have plenty of optimisations ahead. We are working hard to adjust certain pages to make them clearer and easier to use. We know there is more to do, and we plan to make trends easier to track, comparisons easier to make, and data more accessible. If you have any feedback on how we can improve – whether that is certain pages and their designs or layouts, or even tracking new data points – please reach out!

## User Experience Improvements

We have redesigned many parts of the website to make it easier to navigate, find information, and understand the data presented. We have worked on improving load times and responsiveness, so you can keep up to date on the go, as well as overall usability. We are committed to making AI Stats a joy to use, no matter how much data we have, and we will continue to refine the user experience based on your feedback.

### Benchmark pages

We have revamped and overhauled the benchmark pages to make them clearer and easier to see which models are performing best, and how scores were achieved, with more detailed information on the methodology used. We plan to continue to work on these pages to make them as easy as possible to interpret, and to filter the data so you can conduct your own analysis.

### API provider pages

We have also redesigned the API provider pages to give a clear overview of the performance data we get from our gateway, so you can see exactly how each provider is performing and which models are being used most. We then also give a breakdown of each set of models provided by the provider, so you can see what models are available per provider, as well as easily see if they are available on the gateway. We plan to adjust this shortly to include detailed pricing information, so you can easily compare models' pricing.

## Updates

I am excited to announce an expansion of the Latest Updates section on the homepage. This section will now feature not only the latest model changes, but also the latest news and YouTube releases, alongside the model updates. With new pages inside the [Updates](https://ai-stats.phaseo.app/updates) section too, there has never been a better place to stay updated in the ever-changing world of AI! Stay tuned for even more updates to this section in the near future, as we plan to add more to keep you up to date with everything AI and AI Stats.

## Our Model Gateway – Alpha

We are also introducing a brand-new unified gateway to use any supported AI model with a single API interface. We are expanding coverage as fast as possible while keeping the service reliable at scale – please stress-test it and tell us what breaks. The integration steps are all covered per model page, and you can find the full API reference in our [docs](/v1/api-reference).

We would not yet recommend the API for production use, but we are excited to get feedback from the community to help us improve it rapidly. We will take any feedback as seriously as possible to make the gateway as reliable and useful as possible.

> Please also be aware we are yet to fully finalise the schema for requests and responses, so these may change in the coming weeks.

### SDKs – Alpha

Today, we are also announcing official SDKs for Python and TypeScript/JavaScript. Pick your preferred package manager and run one of the commands below to get up and running.

#### Python SDK

The Python SDK provides a simple interface to interact with the Model Gateway, manage API keys, and handle requests/responses.

```bash
pip install ai-stats-py-sdk
```

#### TypeScript / JavaScript SDK

The TypeScript/JavaScript SDK makes it easy to integrate AI models into web and backend applications, with first-class async support and built-in error handling.

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash title="npm"
    npm install @ai-stats/sdk
    ```

    ```bash title="pnpm"
    pnpm install @ai-stats/sdk
    ```

    ```bash title="yarn"
    yarn add @ai-stats/sdk
    ```

    ```bash title="bun"
    bun add @ai-stats/sdk
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

We plan to expand SDK support to other languages based on community feedback, so please let us know what you would like to see next!

## Our Future Plan

Right from the start of AI Stats, we believe that a completely public, open source approach is the best way to build a reliable, trustworthy service. We want to continue this with our new version of AI Stats, which is why the entire source code for the website, gateway, and database is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AI-Stats/AI-Stats). We welcome contributions, feature ideas, and performance testing - help us push the limits of infra together to build a better gateway, and a better AI Stats. Open to everyone, built by the community.

We plan to currently work at a rapid pace to expand data coverage, refine the user experience and expand our gateway. We have a public [roadmap](https://ai-stats.phaseo.app/roadmap) of features and improvements we want to make, but we are always open to feedback from our users to help us prioritise what matters most to them.
