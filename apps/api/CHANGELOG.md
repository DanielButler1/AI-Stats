- [#8](https://github.com/DanielButler1/AI-Stats/pull/8) [`144dad5`](https://github.com/DanielButler1/AI-Stats/commit/144dad5cbf8f56b0e1d987b0eafb9d0be5a98d5e) Thanks [@DanielButler1](https://github.com/DanielButler1)! - Updated the Gateway API schema to be a superset of OpenAI’s request/response formats.
