					1. Who we are and how this Policy applies
				</h2>
				<p className="mt-2 text-foreground/80">
					For the purposes of UK and EU data protection law,{" "}
					<span className="font-medium">Daniel Butler</span>, trading
					as <span className="font-medium">Phaseo</span>, is the
					&quot;data controller&quot; responsible for personal data
					collected through AI Stats.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-2 text-foreground/80">
					This Privacy Policy applies when you:
				</p>
				<ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 text-foreground/80">
					<li>browse the AI Stats website or documentation;</li>
					<li>create and use an AI Stats account;</li>
					<li>
						use the AI Stats Gateway to route requests to
						third-party model providers; or
					</li>
					<li>
						interact with us via email, support channels or other
						communications.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p className="mt-2 text-foreground/80">
					Third-party model providers (for example OpenAI, Anthropic,
					Google, xAI and others) have their own privacy and data
					handling practices. When we forward your requests to them,
					they usually act as independent controllers of your data
					under their own terms and policies. You should review those
					policies separately.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section aria-labelledby="privacy-data-we-collect">
				<h2
					id="privacy-data-we-collect"
					className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground/90"
				>
					2. Data we collect
				</h2>

				<h3 className="mt-3 text-lg font-semibold text-foreground/80">
					2.1 Information you provide to us
				</h3>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					We collect information that you choose to provide directly,
					such as:
				</p>
				<ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 text-foreground/80">
					<li>
						<strong>Account details</strong> – for example your
						name, email address, organisation name, and password
						(stored as a hashed value) when you register.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Profile and team information</strong> – details
						you add to your account or team profile, such as display
						names or project labels.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Billing information</strong> – records relating
						to your purchases of Credits or subscriptions (for
						example currency, amount paid, timestamps). Card details
						are handled by our payment providers (such as Stripe)
						and are not stored in full on our servers.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Support and communication</strong> – emails,
						messages and other communications you send to us (for
						example bug reports, feedback, or feature requests).
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Optional public data</strong> – if you opt in to
						sharing certain usage or app information publicly (for
						example, public app-usage pages or sponsor listings), we
						will process and display that information in accordance
						with your choices.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold text-foreground/80">
					2.2 Inputs and Outputs sent through the Gateway
				</h3>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					When you call models via the AI Stats Gateway, you send
					requests (&quot;Inputs&quot;) and receive responses
					(&quot;Outputs&quot;). These may include text or other data
					that could contain personal information, depending on what
					you choose to send.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					Our design goal is to minimise what we store:
				</p>
				<ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 text-foreground/80">
					<li>
						We{" "}
						<span className="font-medium">
							do not persistently store
						</span>{" "}
						the raw text of your prompts or the full text of model
						Outputs in our primary database or analytics tools.
					</li>
					<li>
						We may temporarily hold Inputs and Outputs in memory or
						transient buffers while processing a request or managing
						streaming, but these buffers are not used as long-term
						storage or training data.
					</li>
					<li>
						We send the necessary content from your request to the
						relevant third-party provider(s) so they can generate an
						Output. Those providers may log or store the data in
						line with their own policies.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					Because you control what you send, you should avoid
					including sensitive personal data in prompts or outputs
					unless it is strictly necessary and you are satisfied with
					the privacy practices of the relevant model providers.
				</p>

				<h3 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold text-foreground/80">
					2.3 Telemetry and technical data
				</h3>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					We automatically collect certain technical and usage
					information when you use the Service, such as:
				</p>
				<ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 text-foreground/80">
					<li>
						<strong>Log and device data</strong> – IP address,
						browser type, operating system, device identifiers, the
						pages you visit, the features you use, timestamps, and
						referrer URLs.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Gateway metrics</strong> – model and provider
						identifiers, request and response timestamps, token
						usage (input, output and other meters), latency, error
						codes, and similar metadata needed to run billing and
						health checks.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Location indicators</strong> – a rough
						geographic approximation (such as country or region)
						derived from your IP address or other signals, used for
						analytics and abuse prevention.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Configuration data</strong> – such as your
						chosen theme/appearance, feature flags, and other
						preferences stored in local storage or cookies.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					We use this telemetry to operate, secure, and improve the
					Service, to calculate usage and pricing, and to give you
					analytics and observability dashboards. We design our
					telemetry to avoid including raw prompt or output text.
				</p>

				<h3 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold text-foreground/80">
					2.4 Cookies and similar technologies
				</h3>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					We use cookies and similar technologies (such as local
					storage, pixels, and scripts) to help our site function and
					to understand how it is used. These may include:
				</p>
				<ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 text-foreground/80">
					<li>
						<strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong> – required
						for security and core features such as login and CSRF
						protection.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Preference cookies</strong> – to remember
						settings like dark mode or your last selected filters.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Analytics cookies</strong> – to measure usage,
						performance and errors, for example via tools like
						Google Analytics or PostHog.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					You can control cookies through your browser settings.
					Blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience or
					prevent certain features from working.
				</p>

				<h3 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold text-foreground/80">
					2.5 Analytics and product telemetry
				</h3>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					We may use third-party analytics and error tracking tools
					(for example, Google Analytics, PostHog, or similar
					services) to help us understand how people use AI Stats and
					to identify where the product can be improved.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					These tools collect information such as pages visited,
					actions taken, device and browser information, and rough
					location data (such as country). We configure these tools so
					that they are not used to store raw prompts, Outputs, or
					other highly sensitive content flowing through the Gateway.

					3. How we use personal data (and our legal bases)
				</h2>
				<p className="mt-2 text-foreground/80">
					We use personal data for the following purposes, under these
					legal bases (for UK/EU users):
				</p>
				<ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-foreground/80">
					<li>
						<strong>To provide and operate the Service</strong> –
						including account creation, gateway routing, usage
						dashboards, billing, and customer support.
						<br />
						<span className="text-xs text-foreground/70">
							Lawful basis: performance of a contract; legitimate
							interests.
						</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>To personalise and improve the Service</strong>{" "}
						– such as understanding which features are used most,
						testing new functionality, and adjusting the UI.
						<br />
						<span className="text-xs text-foreground/70">
							Lawful basis: legitimate interests.
						</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>To communicate with you</strong> – for example,

						or policies.
						<br />
						<span className="text-xs text-foreground/70">
							Lawful basis: performance of a contract; legitimate

					<li>
						<strong>
							To send optional updates or product news
						</strong>{" "}
						– where you have signed up to receive them or where
						local law allows us to do so.
						<br />
						<span className="text-xs text-foreground/70">
							Lawful basis: consent (or legitimate interests,
							where permitted).
						</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>
							To prevent abuse, enforce our Terms, and protect the
							Service
						</strong>{" "}
						– for example by monitoring high-risk patterns of usage,
						rate limit bypass attempts, or fraud.
						<br />
						<span className="text-xs text-foreground/70">
							Lawful basis: legitimate interests; legal
							obligations.
						</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>To comply with legal obligations</strong> – such
						as keeping records for tax, accounting, or responding to
						legitimate requests from authorities.
						<br />
						<span className="text-xs text-foreground/70">
							Lawful basis: legal obligations.
						</span>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p className="mt-2 text-foreground/80">
					We may also create aggregated, anonymised statistics about
					model adoption, benchmark results, or API performance. These
					statistics do not identify individual users.

					4. How we share personal data
				</h2>
				<p className="mt-2 text-foreground/80">
					We do <span className="font-medium">not</span> sell your
					personal data. We may share personal data in the following
					limited situations:
				</p>
				<ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-foreground/80">
					<li>
						<strong>Service providers</strong> – We use trusted
						third parties to help us operate the Service (for
						example, hosting providers, database providers such as
						Supabase, analytics platforms, payment processors such
						as Stripe, email providers, and customer support tools).
						They may access personal data only to perform services
						for us and are contractually required to protect it.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Third-party model providers</strong> – When you
						send requests through the Gateway, we share your Inputs
						and necessary metadata with the model provider(s) you
						choose or that we route to. Those providers process the
						data under their own terms and privacy policies.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Public data you choose to share</strong> – If
						you opt into public usage pages, share integrations, or
						otherwise choose to publish certain information via AI
						Stats, we will display that information according to
						your settings.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Legal and safety reasons</strong> – We may
						disclose data if we reasonably believe it is necessary
						to comply with a law, court order, or other legal
						request, or to protect the rights, property or safety of
						ourselves, our users, or others.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Business transfers</strong> – If we explore or
						undertake a merger, acquisition, reorganisation or sale
						of assets, personal data may be transferred as part of
						that process. We will take reasonable steps to ensure
						the recipient continues to protect your data in line
						with this Policy.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>With your consent</strong> – We may share your
						information for other purposes if you explicitly ask us
						to or consent to it.
					</li>

					5. International transfers
				</h2>
				<p className="mt-2 text-foreground/80">
					We are based in the United Kingdom, but we use service
					providers and infrastructure located in other countries (for
					example, within the European Economic Area and the United
					States). This means your personal data may be transferred to
					and processed in countries that may have different data
					protection laws to those in your home jurisdiction.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-2 text-foreground/80">
					Where we transfer personal data outside of the UK or EEA, we
					take steps to ensure an appropriate level of protection,
					such as relying on:
				</p>
				<ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 text-foreground/80">
					<li>
						countries that the UK or EU has deemed
						&quot;adequate&quot;;

						available.

				<p className="mt-2 text-foreground/80">
					We retain personal data for as long as reasonably necessary
					to fulfil the purposes described in this Policy, including:
				</p>
				<ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 text-foreground/80">

					<li>
						<strong>Objection</strong> – to object to certain types
						of processing, including direct marketing or processing
