				<h3 className="mt-3 text-base font-semibold text-foreground">
					3.1 Credits and wallet
				</h3>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					Some parts of the Service (such as routing requests through
					the AI Stats gateway) may require payment via a pre-paid,
					deposit-based wallet or credit balance
					(&quot;Credits&quot;). The applicable pricing will be shown
					in advance and is currently denominated in{" "}
					<span className="font-medium">US dollars (USD)</span>.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					When you purchase Credits, you are buying a balance that can
					be used to pay for eligible usage of the Service. You are
					responsible for all usage that consumes Credits from your
					account.
				</p>

				<h3 className="mt-3 text-base font-semibold text-foreground">
					3.2 Payment processing (Stripe)
				</h3>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					All payments for Credits are processed by third-party
					payment providers such as Stripe. By providing a payment
					method, you authorise us and our payment processors to
					charge the amounts shown at checkout.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					We do not store your full card details on our own servers.
					Storage and processing of card details is handled by Stripe
					in accordance with their security standards and terms.
				</p>

				<h3 className="mt-3 text-base font-semibold text-foreground">
					3.3 Auto top-up
				</h3>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					You may choose to enable an automatic top-up feature for
					your wallet (&quot;Auto Top-Up&quot;). If you enable Auto
					Top-Up, you:
				</p>
				<ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 text-foreground/80">
					<li>
						authorise us and our payment processor to automatically

						disable Auto Top-Up in your account settings.

					3.4 Refunds and expiry

					3.5 Pricing changes and billing errors
				</h3>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					We may update our pricing from time to time. Where changes
					are material and affect you, we will give reasonable notice
					(for example, via email or in-product notification).
					Continued use of the paid features after the effective date
					of any change constitutes your acceptance of the new
					pricing.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					If we discover a billing error (for example, an incorrect
					rate or token count applied), we may correct the error by
					adjusting your Credits balance. If you believe you have been
					incorrectly charged, please contact us as soon as possible.
					Where we confirm an error in your favour, we will credit or
					refund the overcharged amount.

					4. Inputs, outputs and your content
				</h2>
				<p className="mt-2 text-foreground/80">
					When you use the Service, you may submit text, prompts, data
					or other material (&quot;Inputs&quot;) and receive
					model-generated responses (&quot;Outputs&quot;). Together,
					Inputs and Outputs are referred to as &quot;User
					Content&quot;.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-2 text-foreground/80">
					You retain ownership of your User Content, subject to:
				</p>
				<ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 text-foreground/80">
					<li>any licences you grant to us under these Terms; and</li>
					<li>
						any terms imposed by the underlying third-party model
						providers (for example, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI,
						etc.).
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 className="mt-3 text-base font-semibold text-foreground">
					4.1 How we handle prompts and outputs
				</h3>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					We route your Inputs to third-party providers via the
					gateway and stream Outputs back to you. We do{" "}
					<span className="font-medium">not</span> persistently store
					the raw text of your prompts or the full text of model
					Outputs, other than temporarily as is technically necessary
					to process the request in flight.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					We do, however, store high-level telemetry and billing
					metadata to power analytics and ensure the Service continues
					to function. This telemetry may include, for example:
				</p>
				<ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 text-foreground/80">
					<li>
						timestamps, model identifiers and provider identifiers;
					</li>
					<li>
						request metrics such as token counts, latency,
						throughput and error codes; and
					</li>
					<li>
						aggregated or anonymised usage statistics for
						performance and product improvement.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					We use this telemetry to operate, maintain and improve the
					Service, and to provide you with usage insights. We do not
					use your prompts or Outputs to train our own models.
				</p>

				<h3 className="mt-3 text-base font-semibold text-foreground">
					4.2 Third-party provider terms
				</h3>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					When you use the gateway to call a model, your request is
					processed by the relevant third-party provider. By using
					those models through the Service, you agree that you are
					also bound by the applicable terms, policies and
					acceptable-use rules of each provider you access.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					It is your responsibility to review and comply with those
					third-party terms. We are not responsible for how those
					providers handle your data or for any changes they make to
					their services or pricing.
				</p>

				<h3 className="mt-3 text-base font-semibold text-foreground">
					4.3 Your responsibilities for User Content
				</h3>
				<p className="mt-1 text-foreground/80">
					You are responsible for your Inputs and your use of Outputs.
					You confirm that:
				</p>
				<ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 text-foreground/80">
					<li>
						you have all necessary rights, permissions and consents
						to submit the Inputs and to use the Outputs; and

						your Inputs and your use of the Service will not
						infringe any intellectual property, privacy or other
						rights, or cause us to violate any law or third-party
						terms.
